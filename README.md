# SudokuSolver
Given a 9x9 2-D array of a sudoku puzzle, it will solve the puzzle for you

## To Use
1. Create a text file with a 9x9 array, or use the provided ``` test.txt ```
   - For blanks, use '0'

2. using whatever Haskell compiler you like(I use stack), simply type in the following command into ```*Main>```
```
solve "[path-to-file]"
```
   - for the provided example, it would look like ```solve "test.txt" ```
